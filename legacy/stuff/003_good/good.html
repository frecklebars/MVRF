		so, it's been decent lately. i don't rot but nor do i grow really. <br>
		trust me it's more than just a rant on homestuck, or skip that part maybe <br><br>
		oh YOU
		<h2 class="highlight">HOMESTUCK AND THE POKEMANS</h2>
		oh GOD, HOMESTUCK <br>
		i've been reading that lately. sort of. let me explain. <br><br>
		<span class="highlight">hussie you fucking madman</span><br>
		<br>
		nobody can understand really how much i admire him. not couse he wrote that dumb ass webcomic, no, there's many webcomics out there. or any other type of media for that matter, and they're all good. but mY ACTUAL MADLAD <br><br><br><br>
		could not care less about his shit
		<br><br><br><br>
		which is something i really sorta admire to be honest. <br>
		<h3 class="highlight">look, homestuck was good, ok?</h3>
		<br>
		but <br>
		for a while. while he cared for it. you see, hussie is a guy who sorta fucks around. he decided one day to make a webcomic so he did. fucked around with it for a while and was ready to depart and go on another project. but <br>
		it took off waaaay more than he probably expected. the little tumblr critters (look don't get me wrong here tumblr is cool and all but fanbases could run completely wild and that's where they usually gather to gas the absolute dumpsterfire they created) took it and put it on the highest fucking pedestal they could find. AND YES IT DESERVED THAT. but why let something enD. lmao nO <br>
		homestuck had the perfect ending. in act 3. that's it that's where it should have ended. but, it didn't. and i don't blame hussie. i don't blame anyone really. hussie did his thing as much as he wanted, too much maybe. but he kept going for whatever reason. i mean the thing was making money. did you know it's been printed? homestuck? a series that takes every advantage it can of it being a webcomic? <span class="highlightmid">printed?</span> yeah lmao. <br><br>
		it's clearly forced now. he couldn't care less about it. ever since the trolls appeared, characters that weren't even supposed to be mains. but he was stuck, what was he to do? honestly. he was and is clearly tired of it. oh how forced it is. 
		<br>some may even call it<br><br><br><br>
		the ideal girlfriend experience
	</div>
	<br><br>
	<div class="textcontent"  style="padding-left: 20%">
		<h2 class="highlight">so how's this summer going alex?</h2>
		<br>
		well it's been better but that's always the answer isn't it? <br>
		tl;dr i'm rotting. more or less. <br>
		it's sorta nice couse i'm taking an ML course. which honestly is not as useful as expected. i mean, it's a great introductory course. i get the concepts but how to actually put them in practice? it's dumb couse nothing about how it <em>actually</em> works is explained really. the overall idea is but eh, could be better. it's a slow process, once i'm done i hope i'll get back on track with my usual youtube learning. really wanted that diploma though. so that takes some hours, then i laze around half asleep and go swimming. both with mom and dad. i won't get much into it. blank space is filled by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TyranitarTube">thamill</a>'s pokemon insurgence series, while i play pokemon volt white 2 myself. i don't do much, but i'll get back on track soon. <br>
		also i finally got to making a bot for discord, i'll write a dedicated post for that but i feel like i could talk about it here too a bit. it's really nice, it does basic things but i've been meaning to make one myself for so long. takes me back honestly. i should write about Rhi too.
		<br><br><br>
		it's been better on that other front too, way better, but thats a post for another time. we'll see

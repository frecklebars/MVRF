	<h1>Changes Changes</h1><hr>
	<a href="https://github.com/frecklebars/homepage"><img src="../images/projectside/project001website.png" align="right" style="padding-right: 40px;"></a>
	<h2 class="highlight">This is mostly a proof of concept about what these project pages are gonna be like.</h2>
	
	<p class="textcontent">At the moment of writing this the site is about one week old? More or less. <br>I'm actually really proud even if most of it is <em>(and will be for quite a while)</em> under construction.</p>
	<hr>

	<h2 class="highlight">Future plans</h2>
	<p class="textcontent">
		First off: obviously finish the basic pages.
		<br><br>
		After that, my to do list for this website goes something like this:
		<dl>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">Make a homepage</dt>
			<dd>This would include the links I'm using the most, maybe make an integrated RSS feed? I don't know, but it should look like a basic hub for myself.</dd>
		</dl>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="textcontent">
		I can't actually think of more stuff to go here but I'll come back when I've got something.
		<hr>
		<h2 class="highlight">Now here's a small changelog:</h2>
		<strong>12 / 03 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>Hey heY hEY images are now local and no longer just <a href="../images/articleside/unf.png">that same pic of Bulma</a> that would just show up everywhere! Nice, right?</dd>
		<dd>Two pages don't work because they don't link to anything because <em>uhhhh </em>I didn't write them yet? It's late c'mon.</dd>
		<dd>On the other hand I'm <strong>SUPER </strong>proud of the work I did today. It's finally all finished (except the <a href="../diary.html">diary</a> but that's a surprise hehe) and looking nice, I changed the look of half of the site and I just did a really good job today, yes.</dd>
		<strong>11 / 03 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>Actually up to now the site is under construction and I've lost the changelog I kept, it's mostly addition to pages and slight CSS changes so I won't make an entry unless something big changes/is added.</dd>

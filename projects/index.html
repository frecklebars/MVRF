		<p class="title">Text Color Predictor</p>
		<img class="banner" src="colorneuralnet/banner.png">
		<p>This was really fun but also a pain to work on. NN with one hidden layer containing 5 neurons in it that takes 3 inputs (RGB values of a random color) and decides whether text over that color should be black or white. Uses back propagation. Written from scratch in JS (there's also a PY ver).</p>

		<p>What and why is this? It's a bot for Discord. Has some cool functionalities like sending random images of Etika or giving you the weather or sending random pokemon. More in the readme. Also replies from time to time. Closest thing I've got to a son. Hosted on a RasPi on my desk. I think he has personality!</p>

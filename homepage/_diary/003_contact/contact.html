	<div class="textcontent">
		well, i might as well continue, seeing as im already writing <br><br><br><br><br><br>
		its been terribly overwhelming. <br>
		its easy to <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">distract</a>, but sometimes i slip, and it catches up. it feels like all of what shouldve been catches up and sticks and stays and its hard <br><br>
		<span class="secret">i sometimes still think of you. i dont hate nor despise you. i dont miss you either. i miss what i had though. it was nice caring for you, and you for me. its been so lonely after that winter. </span><br><br><br>
		i wish now <br>
		upon a prayer <br>
		i wish you saw me <br>
		i wish you saw the scars i brandish <br>
		i promised ill be strong <br>
		i was under oath, to move along <br>
		but its hard and im crying <br>
		and i wish you came here <br>
		and sat down by me <br>
		it just feels so alone <br>
		like i dont know anyone <br>
		but the night sky above <br>
		<br>
		so save me god.

		I'm tryna keep it short, Warframe's downloading and not rly in the mood <br>
		I started doing a bunch of stuff. Especially coding. Especially<em>er</em> Unity. Truthfully the thought of dropping out crossed my mind at this point. It makes me feel so at home. I can limitlessly create and learn. I feel like there could go days where all I do is make dumb ass little games while learning how to do much cooler stuff to <em>actually implement into my stuff oh god this feels so good to say</em>. I like making stuff. Until I don't anymore. <br><br>


		<em>oh but wait <br> warframe finished downloading <br></em>
	</p>
	<div class="textcontent" style="float: right" align="right">this side prolly shouldn't be empty <br> it's bad web design !!!</div>

		Going on, <br> oh god there's some dude choking in my headphones what sorta dumb ass music is this <br><br>
		<a href="https://www.thelittlepeople.ro/en/what-we-do/">ah yes the little ones</a><br>

		They're called "Little People" for a reason. Or should I say "we're called"? It's not as mentally taxing as people say seeing dying kids would be. I'm (weirdly?) able to see them as just ordinary people, so it's nothing really. Bees are nice. These retards keep telling me how I should be crying seeing kids so young in that state, how I should feel sorry for them (but without actually feeling sorry, we're running an organisation here afterall ):< ), but, if you feel sorry for someone, do you do it for them or? I get how sensible you are and oh lord gracious how humble and pure you are, but maybe the kids want someone they can befriend and to play with, not someone with a tiled head <strong>.</strong>

	<div id="tempo" style="float: right" align="right">((if anyone happens across this, it's not the ppl in the actual organisation telling me this. its the common everyday ones you meet on the regular(or i do idk, the ppl in the actual association(nice vocab expansion there)are so far nice and good hearted which i appreciate))hope i explained uselessly, i just felt sorta bad)))ha)<br>really kinda ruined my workflow here didn't i</div><br><br>

	<p class="textcontent">
		But yeah it's good it's always good isn't it. I can just do my own thing. In the end, I always arrive in my house and can drown myself in creating and coming up with ideas and learning and <em>doing my own thing y'know</em><br><br>
	</p>
	so there's at least that <br><br><br>
	oh my fucking god warframe just finished installing and started playing some creepy ass music and my FUCKING HEART IS STILL RUNNING I FORGOT ABOUT IT

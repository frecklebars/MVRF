	<div class="textcontent">
		I'm fat I guess you'll see in a (sorta) soon to be <a href="">article about the Comic Con I went to</a>. <span class="secret">which was fun as shit holy shit</span>
		Ok not fat but really out of shape. Which is ok? I guess. A lot of people tell me I look good but I'm still not satisfied with myself, my body is weird and blobby (is that a word), It could be so much better. <br>
		<br>Haha y'all really gonna sit here and read about me whining well no not really. <br>
		<span class="secret">its not like anyone reads these anyway so its ok</span>
		<h3 class="highlight">but here's the thing</h3>
		Today marks the first day of my weight loss project (nice nice I know). I should stop calling everything a project but it sounds nice so whatever. The big ones are gonna be in <a href="../../../index.html">the sky</a> anyway. I started today with taking a before pic so I could compare it with others to come. Basically this all consists of less food ate in a day, healthier meals, running when the sun's about to set, and in two weeks when the school year ends, going back to swimming.

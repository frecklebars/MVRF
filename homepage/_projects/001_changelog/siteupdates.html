	<p class="textcontent"><s>At the moment of writing this the site is about one week old? More or less.</s> <br>I'm actually really proud even if most of it is <em>(and will be for quite a while)</em> under construction.</p>

		<s>First off: obviously finish the basic pages.</s><br>wow I did that
		<br><br>
		After that, my to do list for this website goes something like this:
		<dl>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">More categories</dt>
			<dd>As in a second navbar, different for each page. For example: the Projects page's second navbar might contain the pages "Games", "Neural Nets", "Cosplays", "Misc."</dd>
			<dd>This might mean merging the <a href="../../_stuff/stuff.html">Stuff I Enjoy</a> and <a href="../../_cheese/cheese.html">Cheesy Bites</a> sections together.</dd><br>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">Make a homepage</dt>
			<dd>This would include the links I'm using the most, maybe make an integrated RSS feed? I don't know, but it should look like a basic hub for myself.</dd><br>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">Learn JavaScript</dt>
			<dd>I mean, it's obvious why. The site is pure html and css. It could be so much more.</dd><br>
			<dt>uhh idk write more?</dt>
		</dl><br>
		<h2 class="highlight"> Done stuff: </h2>
		<dl>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">Playlist</dt>
			<dd><s>It's gonna make more sense when <a href="../../playlist.html">it's done</a></s></dd><br>
			<dt class="highlight" style="font-size: 20px">Change domain name</dt>
			<dd>frecklebars.github.io/homepage is long and ugly</dd><br>
		</dl>

		I can't actually think of more stuff to go here but I'll come back when I've got something.

		<h2 class="highlight">Now here's a small changelog:</h2>
		<strong>29 / 05 / 2019 (soon to be 30th)</strong>
		<dd><a href="../../index.html">The sky</a> is up. (haha get it)</dd>
		<dd><strong>SKY EXPLANATION: </strong>The projects page is dumb and vague. The sky branches out into multiple main projects of mine, for easier access, while the projects section of this branch will take care of smaller things.</dd>
		<strong>17 / 05 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>mvrf.cf lives</dd>
		<strong>11(or maybe 12) / 05 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>The entrance to the diary is hidden</dd>
		<dd>very weakly but hidden</dd>
		<strong>20 / 04 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>I did like a ton of file reorganising and now each article has its own separate folder. They are all stand alone now and I can add and remove to my heart's content. <br>which is nice</dd>
		<strong>16 / 03 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>I'd say the website is done. There are no dead links as far as I'm aware. And I'm actually really happy with how it turned out.</dd>
		<dd>The new square thing on the right of the front page with the sticky posts and news and stuff yeah that's new.</dd>
		<dd>I made a pretty tasty sandwich.</dd>
		<strong>12 / 03 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>Hey heY hEY images are now local and no longer just <a href="../../_cheese/001_friday/unf.png">that same pic of Bulma</a> that would just show up everywhere! Nice, right?</dd>
		<dd>Two pages don't work because they don't link to anything because <em>uhhhh </em>I didn't write them yet? It's late c'mon.</dd>
		<dd>On the other hand I'm <strong>SUPER </strong>proud of the work I did today. It's finally all finished (except the <a href="../../_diary/zdiary.html">diary</a> but that's a surprise hehe) and looking nice, I changed the look of half of the site and I just did a really good job today, yes.</dd>
		<strong>11 / 03 / 2019</strong>
		<dd>Actually up to now the site is under construction and I've lost the changelog I kept, it's mostly addition to pages and slight CSS changes so I won't make an entry unless something big changes/is added.</dd>

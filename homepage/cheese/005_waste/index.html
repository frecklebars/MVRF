		four seasons dead fly by <br>
		and i <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Qhz1LCqXg">cry</a> <br>
		<h2 class="highlight">fucking ass shit days i hate</h2>
		ITS SHITTY <br>
		I GO AWAY AND DONT DO SHIT <br>
		its like, im not even me anymore. my passion seems to have gone. i want to do all these things but, , i just cant bring myself to?? and its MY fault i know that! i am aware but its; <br><br>
		i dont understand!<br>
		oh but each day feels like a monday!! its hard to look forward to the next day, nothing is happening!. i cant even cry. <br><br><br>
		but, well <br>
		<h2 class="highlight">its just a downfall</h2>
		oh im sure its normal. as it usually is. but fuck that it still feels shitty. IM SURE future me will look back and be thankful, the same way i look back on <a href="">that winter</a>,, and im growing im sure this isnt time as wasted as i tell myself it is daily. but hell its still shitty to get it. its overwhelming, and hard to keep up with. my days are filled with gloom and boredom. THERE ARE THINGS I COULD DOO BUT, ? is hard. and the fear is overwhelming. i have it on my mind almost 24/7 its exhausting. <br><br>
		but <br><br>
		as always <br><br>
		<h2 class="highlight">things still bring me joy</h2>
		sometimes when i get all this dread, all this gloom and sadness, its easier to hide. i cant and wont ignore it endlessly, im sure at some point <br> <br>hopefully sooner than later. <br>
		ill get trough. and ill start making things again. and ill feel thankful for this couse, im growing yknow, <br>
		sorta even starting to feel nicer yknow :') <br><br>
		tomorrow ill finish the lil javascript course i been doing and boot up unity again, ill redo the only neural net i ever did to brush up on my completely forgotten skills. sure, some time may have been used better. but oh well, what can you do. next time <br><br>ill know
		<br><br>
		<br>
		i needed this out of my system. <br>to whoever read this, thank you

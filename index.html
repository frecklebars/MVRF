		<p>Hi, I'm Alex. <br>I'm an 18 year old high school student living in Romania.</p>
		<p>I'm a Creator. I enjoy starting different creative projects. While mostly are computer related (e.g. programming), anything that allows me to express myself will do. I believe creating gives you the opportunity to grow, while researching new ways to solve different problems you might encounter, you learn new ways of thinking, come across different opinions, methods of work, mentalities even. All of that allows you to gain a bigger perspective on the little things you do every day, and in the end, feel much much reconciled with yourself.</p>
		<p>The point of this website is for me to keep track of all my projects and post updates. Most things I do are for myself, and I don't expect others to come here really, but I still think it's nice.<br> In the end, <em>it makes me happy</em>.

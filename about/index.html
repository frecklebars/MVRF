		<p class="title">about me</p>
		<p>My full name is Alexandru Popa, I'm 18 years old. I was born in Bucharest, Romania and I absolutely love chocolate milk and grilled cheese sandwiches. Might have mentioned this before but I love creating different things. Of course, this comes with the process of learning, but I love that even more. Just think it's really nice to have a bunch of hobbies that let you grow and fill your alone days. I also adore collecting stuff, maybe I'll make a page dedicated to that. Anyway, here's a bunch of pics of me :P</p>

		<p class="title tab" onclick="expandi()">chapter I: origin story (:</p>
		<p id="i" class="introp">I think it's safe to say coding is my greatest passion. When I was a kid my dad sat me at his computer and showed me how to do all sorts of stuff. Mostly play games. One of which Monkey Island 2 which I believe had a big part in adapting my tastes today (basically look at this whole site :P). Being a fairly shy kid, I spent more and more time inside on computers. At some point dad showed me <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, and encouraged me mess around with it. I did and I loved it. I started getting more accustomed to coding and wanted more and more. Eventually, I picked up a real coding language and started to learn basic algorithms and concepts. Years later, loads of chocolate milk bottles drunk, thousands of ideas written, pokemon caught and Monkey Islands replayed, here I am. </p>
		<p class="title tab" onclick="expandii()">chapter II: "so what exactly do you do?"</p>
		<p id="ii" class="introp">I create. I have about 10 new ideas every hour. Ok, right now I'm still just a high school student (in my senior year so college soon :P), so my main job is that. But in my free time I work on my hobbies. I make software and draw. I write. I read about different things of interest. Right now I'm really interested in how the <em>really</em> brain works. Ever thought how when you chew, in all the mess in your mouth, you never chew on your tongue. Ever wondered how instincts are actually stored and passed down? Or what dreams <em>really</em> are? Yeah, it's a fascinating thing. Have I also mentioned how much I adore cooking?</p>
		<p class="title tab" onclick="expandiii()">chapter III: stuff to take on a deserted island</p>
		<p id="iii" class="introp">Also known as "things I like", to clear up any confusion. Well, I already talked about my hobbies, but preferences are by no means limited to that. I adore card games. My mainly played ones are the Pokemon TCG and Magic: the Gathering. What I love more about them is the collecting aspect. I ADORE collecting stuff. I have a card collection that I might show off at some point. I also collect albums and vinyls, but I'm not really limited to that, any item that has any personal value to me will do. Another thing I'm really into is collecting media. One neat little hard drive can hold hours and hours of content. I have loads of books, shows, movies and especially music. I'll talk more about what albums and artists I like in a separate post it's too much to fit here. Honestly I don't have a favorite movie, but I liked Rocky, the Usual Suspects, and Groundhog Day a lot. My favorite book is easier for I love this one waaaay more than any other of the books I read. It's called No Longer Human, written by Osamu Dazai. I still cant tell if it should really be called an autobiography, but it was amazing. My favorite shows are Seinfeld and M*A*S*H. Comedy was invented alongside Seinfeld. I'm really into Dragon Ball and JoJo too, as mangas. They have a distinct feeling from western comics, and I usually enjoy the manga art style more too. My favorite cartoon is Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy. Why? Why not. Nostalgia I guess, but I regularly rewatch it. I didn't even get to talk about games. I love the old Scumm games, Monkey Island 2 is my all time favorite, but second and third place are taken by I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, and Loom. On the other hand, I also love the Pokemon games because they combine collecting, complex variety and a huge competitive scene in one portable medium. Last one I want to mention is Portal 2, for the interesting and unique puzzles, but also the great story.</p>
		<p class="title tab" onclick="expandiv()">chapter IV: finally, dreams</p>
		<p id="iv" class="introp">To be the father to my future daughter. But there's ways until that is even part of the question. Something closer is that I wanna feed one of my biggest intrests, and what I wanna do in the future professionally, machine learning and neural networks. Artificial intelligence in general. I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44">video once where a dude made an a.i. that played Super Mario World</a>. Except it didn't just play, it <em>learned</em> how to play, and honestly that got to me. I started watching more and more vids like that and that's it, I wanted to do it. So I started teaching myself through YouTube or other resources on the internet. It's a fascinating topic even if it's confusing. But I always liked a challange, and oh boy the amount of ideas of things I could make with this skill really keeps me going. Soon I'll apply for college and I hope I can study it more in depth there. As for dreams that feed my more creative part, there's not much I want to do that I can't do or I'm not doing now. I paint and draw and sometimes dabble in making video games. I write a lot. Simply having an idea and developping it more, making stories for it, characters, storylines, plots. Being able to write all of that and make it come alive with drawings/animation/games brings me so much joy. I always wanted to learn to cook in a professional manner (and be addressed as Chef Alex). Maybe one day I'll also release a clothes line. Who knows? I have all this time. :')</p>
